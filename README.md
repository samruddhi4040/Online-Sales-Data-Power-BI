Project learnings:                                             
-Created an interactive dashboard using Power BI.                                    
-Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slices.                                     
-Created connections, join new tables, calculations to manipulate data and enable user driven parameters for visualization.                                      
-Used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, slicers, cards)   
-Used ArcGIS to point out and display real time locations on the map.       
I have also uploaded the datasets used by me and the wallpapers used for background enhancement.                
The .pbix file has also been uploaded which can be previewed after downloading.
